# mobile-orientation
Handling of orientation of mobile devices to interact with embedded 3D scenes in a browser

This is mostly prototype code and examples. There are several blog posts describing the use of sterographic split-screen displays
  Use: http://realism.com/blog/steroscopic-model-views
  Code: http://realism.com/blog/3d-google-cardboard
  
and how to make this orientation code work (http://realism.com/blog/tracking-device-motion).

This library also requires the use of X3DOM (.js and .css - see http://x3dom.org/) and jQuery.
